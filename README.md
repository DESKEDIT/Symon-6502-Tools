# Symon-6502-Tools

A set of python tools designed to make using the Symon 6502 emulator [here](https://github.com/sethm/symon/)!

## TODO

> Make code compiler take in actual 6502 code
> 
> Add code decompiler
> 
> Add better support for longer code as Symon's documentation does not show where the value of the starting position
